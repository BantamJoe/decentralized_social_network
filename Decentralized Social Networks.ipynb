    "- If someone is an expert in NodeJS, they put up a claim and attach proof such as their GitHub repos\n",
    "- Other members in the same domain on Indorse verify it. Based on the consensus, the claim is either ‘indorsed’ or flagged.”\n",
    "- users are rewarded for their activity on the platform with IND tokens. These tokens can later be traded or used on the platform to purchase services like advertising, or company pages with validated connections.\n",

    "######  STEEM POWER (SP)\n",
    "- It is Steem that is vested into the platform and does not remain liquid (immediately trade-able) once vested. \n",
    "- It is the standard measurement of how much influence a user has in the Steem network. \n",
    "- The more Steem Power a user holds, the more they can influence the value of posts and comments they upvote\n",

    "###### STEEM DOLLAR (SBD)\n",
    "\n",
    "- It isl liquid, stable-value currency tokens designed to be pegged to 1 USD \n",
    "- SBD is basically a token value of which is deigned to remain equal to one USD of Steem value (explained later). \n",

    "- Author Rewards: When you publish a post or a comment and other users upvote it, you earn author rewards.\n",
    "- Curation Rewards: When another author publishes a post you get rewarded a share of the value of your upvote as curation reward.\n",
    "- Steem blockchain stores content + currency. \n",
    "- All the content published on Steemit is permanently stored on the blockchain. \n",
    "- It is immutable, meaning you cannot delete it from the blockchain, even if you delete it from the website. \n",
    "- Whenever you create or upvote content, you actually are doing a transaction on the Steem blockchain and that transaction is permanently stored.\n",
    "- The immutability means total freedom from censorship.\n",
    "- The upvote system means decentralization and power in your hands.\n",
    "- Proof of Brain means you can mine Steem with your brain\n",
    "- Steem is not mined. It was mine-able initially but the mining was stopped by Steemit Inc. \n",
    "- All the Steem in circulation or supply is premined except a small percentage which is created annually through inflation "
